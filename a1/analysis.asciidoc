|========================================================

As we increase the number of dimensions in the distributed representation and
the number of hidden units, the cross entropy error goes down. We run the risk
of over-fitting our network to the data if we increase its capacity
continuously but since our models do early stopping we are disregarding it and
chosing model(32, 256) as the best since it has the lowest validaton and test
cross entropy error.
